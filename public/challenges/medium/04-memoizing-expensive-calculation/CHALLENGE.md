# Memoizing Expensive Calculation

**Difficulty:** medium  
**Topics:** useMemo

## Learning goals

- Skip recomputation when deps unchanged
- Identify expensive pure functions

## Challenge

Given a slow `fibonacci(n)` and slider input n, display result. Without useMemo UI stutters; with useMemo it is smooth. Compare both modes.

## Requirements

1. useMemo around fib(n)
2. Deps [n]
3. Show elapsed ms optional

## Starter hint

Implement in **your own** React project (Vite, Next.js, etc.) or a sandbox—e.g. `src/practice/medium/04-memoizing-expensive-calculation/`. Reference write-ups in this repo live under `challenges/medium/04-memoizing-expensive-calculation/` (not loaded by the app).

```tsx
function fib(n: number): number { /* iterative slow */ }
```

## Hints

1. useMemo(() => fib(n), [n])
2. Do not call fib directly in render without memo

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Memoized path smooth
- [ ] Changing unrelated state does not recompute
